This repository contains packages for interacting with Plan 9 as well
as ports of common Plan 9 libraries and tools. Has additional
utilities and API features not implemented in the upstream 9fans
repository. These are largely customizations to better support
[rjkroege/edwood: Go version of Plan9 Acme
Editor](https://github.com/rjkroege/edwood).

I intend to upstream these changes to 9fans as review permits.

The observant will see that this repo contains a Go version of Acme
that hues more closely to original Acme and wonder why Edwood also
exists. I aspire to add features to Edwood that eventually
differentiate it from Acme.
